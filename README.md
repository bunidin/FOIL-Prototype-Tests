## FOIL-Prototype-Tests
Based on [FOIL-Prototype](https://github.com/dabaez/FOIL-Prototype) by Arenas et al.
If you want to try out the experiments for yourself it is recommended to clone this repository, and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/dabaez/FOIL-Prototype), as we have fixed some bugs such as not allowing us to execute anything (Credit: Bernardo Subercaseaux). Furthermore we provide a second dataset for testing.
### Changes Made
- Added new Dataset "[Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/14/breast+cancer)" Dataset for testing with a corresponding [breast_cancer_queries.py](breast_cancer_queries.py) (by BÃ¼nyamin Dincer) which works with the FOIL-Prototype Implementation.
- Replaced old antlr version with the latest antlr v3.13.1.
- Fixed [experiments.sh](experiments.sh)
- Make sure to run everything in Python 3.

Tested on Mac.

I do NOT own this implementation. All I did is fix some bugs and add another datset for testing. All the credit goes to: [FOIL-Prototype](https://github.com/dabaez/FOIL-Prototype).
